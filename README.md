# Mobile Apps Project

This project consists of multiple mobile applications created for a school task using Expo. The folders contain only the files that I edited for each app.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up an Expo environment. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Install Expo CLI**: If you haven't already, install Expo CLI globally by running the following command:
    ```bash
     npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
2. **Create a New Expo Project**: Use the following command to create a new Expo project:
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest
   ```

3. **Add Edited Files**: Once your project is set up, you can copy the files from one of the folders in this repository into your new Expo project's directory.

4. **Run the Project**: Navigate to your project folder and start the Expo development server:
      ```bash
      npx expo start
      ```
